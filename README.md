# lazor_project

Some notes:
    - file to read bff files and store information about board, lasers, and target points (COMPLETED)
    - file to generate all possible boards (COMPLETED)
    - file for defining block and laser classes (in progress)
    - file to check each potential board if it is the correct solution - that is the laser(s) will go through target points. Then, we want to print out text file with solution grid, like which type of blocks in what position on grid (could just be the grid/board with numbers corresponding to types of blocks or lack of block)
    - use time module to compute how long it take to get the solution
