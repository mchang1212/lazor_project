# lazor_project

Some notes:
    - file to read bff files and store information about board, lasers, and target points (COMPLETED)
    - file to generate all possible boards (COMPLETED)
    - file to generate laser paths
    - file to check if lasers will go through target points for a particular board
    - use time module to compute how long it take to get the solution
    - print out text file with solution? like which type of blocks in what position on grid (could be instructions like place an A block in position 2,3 or could just be the grid/board with numbers corresponding to types of blocks)
